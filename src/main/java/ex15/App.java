/*
Passwords are validated by comparing a user-provided value with a known value that’s stored. Either it’s correct or it’s not.

Create a simple program that validates user login credentials. The program must prompt the user for a username and password. The program should compare the password given by the user to a known password. If the password matches, the program should display “Welcome!” If it doesn’t match, the program should display “I don’t know you.”

Example Output
What is the password? 12345
I don't know you.
Or

What is the password? abc$123
Welcome!
Constraints
Use an if/else statement for this problem.
Make sure the program is case sensitive.
